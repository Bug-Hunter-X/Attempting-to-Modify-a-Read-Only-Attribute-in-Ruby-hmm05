# Attempting to Modify a Read-Only Attribute in Ruby

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby: attempting to modify a read-only attribute. The `bug.rb` file showcases code that tries to modify an attribute designed for read-only access, resulting in a `NoMethodError`. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides a corrected version with methods to properly modify the attribute. 

This example highlights the importance of designing classes with clear getter and setter methods to control attribute modification.
